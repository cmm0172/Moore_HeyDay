## What is Hey Day?
Hey Day is Auburn Universitie's way of fostering the feeling of connectedness amongst all that set foot on its campus. From fun activities to wearing a name tag all day, Auburn ensures that every student, faculty, and staff that walk on the campus feel a sense of belonging and love that each student embodies as a member of our family. Please view the link for more information regarding this beloved tradition (http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).

## Hey Day Script
The purpose of this script is to vritually recreate the typical conversation that one might hear around campus as you walk to class. Friendly faces and strangers alike say "Hey (insert name here" according to your name tag. This script does that as well; in a very simplified version, this script simply prompts the user for their name and then responds with "Hey [name]!". That is the end of the program.
